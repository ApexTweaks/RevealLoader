# RevealLoader
Tweak to use RevealApp (https://revealapp.com) to inspect iOS Apps

Currently only works in apps. Trying to inspect SpringBoard will throw an error and freeze your device, which will then result your phone to respring after < minute.

If you manage to get it working in SpringBoard, do a pull request and we will accept it, if everything works.
